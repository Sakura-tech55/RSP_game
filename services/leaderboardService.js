 * Score model.
 *
 * A claimed run is worth the triangular sum of its levels, so depth compounds
 * (level 10 is worth far more than two level-5 runs), multiplied by the room's
 * leaderboard multiplier. Practice has multiplier 0 and therefore never scores,
 * which is what stops free runs from inflating the board.
 *
 * Scoring is computed here, on the server, from the persisted run — never from
 * a client-supplied total.
